# demo-LED-display

A demo python script to interact with IoTeX blockchain and display messages on LED. This was a demo on CES. See 
https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CES2019%20%23iotex&src=typed_query
for recorded videos

## prepare
You need a raspberry PI and MAX7219 Dot Matrix (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EJ1AFW8/) to make the demo work.

## run script
```
python listen.py
```

## NOTE
This script works with a former IoTeX testnet Stovan. It needs some update to work with current mainnet. PRs are welcome!
